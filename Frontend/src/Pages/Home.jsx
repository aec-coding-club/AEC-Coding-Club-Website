                  The AEC Coding Club started its journey on 11 April 2021. Its
                  major objective is to motivate students' interest in learning
                  various technologies and to obtain information about how
                  technology will be used to project work. The club's goal is to
                  encourage students to solve various challenging problems using
                  demanding technologies which include Python, Java, C, C++,
                  etc. Our approach will help students to become Industry Ready.
                  This will boost them to get Job. The AEC Coding Club actively
                  organizes various activities like Online Coding Contest,
                  Online Quiz Contest, etc. Other events like Expert's Talk,
                  Alumni Talk, and Hands-on practical workshops for various
                  programming basics are planned for the future.
